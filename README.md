# Section

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Add a `type.css` file with the default values from [Typografier](https://typografier.web-dev.tools/).
- All of the content and basic CSS is already complete in the HTML.
- Add the Typografier specific classes necessary to make the layout match the screenshots: things like gutter, font-size, push, stylistic classes, etc.
- **Only add classes to the HTML—do nothing else. (Adding the `type.css` file `<link>` is expected.)**
- **DO NOT change the CSS file.**
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Goal

Visually match the images in the “screenshots” folder.

- Final screenshots in the “screenshots” folder.
